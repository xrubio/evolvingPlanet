	<key>LEVEL1M1</key>
	<string>Professor, welcome to the Console.
Cool interface, isn't it? I hope you like it because you&apos;ll spend the next weeks looking at it and drinking coffee.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M2</key>
	<string>The Console shows you data collected by satellites deployed around the planet.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M3</key>
	<string>The mission takes place within this landscape.
It is full of features, from the highlighted arid region to forests rich in resources.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M4</key>
	<string>You can tap anytime the goal icon to show a summary of the environment.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M5</key>
	<string>These are your bots.
We have deployed a small initial population in this area.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M6</key>
	<string>This first mission has one dispersal goal.
You should drive your bots to the blinking hexagon in your bottom right.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M7</key>
	<string>Tap the Play button to see what are your bots doing.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M8</key>
	<string>The bots move, reproduce and die on their own, but you can guide them using some cool tools.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M9</key>
	<string>The first one is the orientation marker.
Tap twice in any place of the map to suggest the dispersal direction.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M10</key>
	<string>The second one is the evolution track.
You begin with 10 EvoPoints and receive additional points during the mission.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M11</key>
	<string>EvoPoints are used to increase the three attributes.
Tap here to spend 1 EvoPoint and upgrade Mobility to Level 2.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M12</key>
	<string>Reproduction controls the fertility of your bots.
Move it to level 2.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M13</key>
	<string>Each change of an attribute costs 1 additional EvoPoints, as it is highlighted in yellow.
Increase it to 3.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M14</key>
	<string>Tap again to set Reproduction to 4.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M15</key>
	<string>Increasing Resistance improves the survival skills of your bots.
Spend the remanining on this attribute.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M16</key>
	<string>Use the remaining 2 EvoPoints to increase Resistance again.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M17</key>
	<string>Deployment finished! Let's see if the bots survive with these traits.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M18</key>
	<string>This panel shows how your population is increasing.
Set now the orientation marker within the goal zone.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M19</key>
	<string>As you can see here you received additional EvoPoints. Good luck!</string>

    <key>LEVEL2M1</key>
	<string>Some missions have more than one goal as shown in the top of the Console.</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M2</key>
	<string>The bright interval shows the time when your population needs to reach the zone according to archaeological evidence.
If you arrive before or after this span the mission will fail.</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M3</key>
	<string>The best arrival time is marked by the highlighted zone.</string>

    <key>LEVEL3M1</key>
	<string>Welcome Professor.
You will use a new tool in this mission.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M2</key>
	<string>The technical term is Temporary Augmentation of Population Attributes Through Bursts in Cultural Traits.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M3</key>
	<string>The team just call them Boosts.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M4</key>
	<string>You can spend EvoPoints to activate them and temporally increase an attribute.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M5</key>
	<string>The first one increases Reproduction. Tap it now.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M6</key>
	<string>The second Boost increases Resistance, and it has an area of effect.
You need to tap and drag towards the zone you wish to improve your bots.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M7</key>
	<string>Boosts have a cooldown period so use them wisely. Good luck!</string>

    <key>LEVEL6M1</key>
    <string>The second Goal of this mission checks the size of your group</string>
    <key>LEVEL6M2</key>
    <string>You need to reach the size highlighted in red here within the assigned time span.</string>
