	<key>LEVEL1M1</key>
	<string>Commander, welcome to the Console. Cool interface, isn&apos;t it?
I hope you like it because you&apos;ll spend the next weeks looking at it! Allow me to give you a quick reminder on how does it work.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M2</key>
	<string>The satellites we deployed around the planet are tracking real-time information about the environment and our agents.
The Console shows you an aggregated of these data, making your life much easier</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M3</key>
	<string>The map shows you the landscape faced by your agents. You can zoom in/out pinching the screen, or pan around sliding your finger through the screen</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M4</key>
	<string>Each scenario is played on a different map containing several geographic features. For example, the zone delimited by this hexagon is a mountain</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M5</key>
	<string>This arid area here has almost no vegetation. Not a comfy area to live.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M6</key>
	<string>Mountains and arid areas delimit regions where resources are scarce, so the agents living there will die faster than usual</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M7</key>
	<string>The environment is not always that dangerous. This zone is a forest, where your agents will find plenty of resources to increase their survival chances</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M8</key>
	<string>Speaking of the devil, these red dots here are your agents. We have deployed a small initial population which is ready to begin evolving.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M9</key>
	<string>This first scenario simulates a dispersion process. Your population needs to colonize the marked zone delimited by the blinking hexagon in your bottom right.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M10</key>
	<string>Your task is to supervise that this population arrives at this goal within a temporal span similar to what the archaeological evidence suggests. The closer you get, the better you understand what happened.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M11</key>
	<string>Let&apos;s see what the population is doing; tap the Play button and let it evolve during a couple of time steps.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M12</key>
	<string>I paused the agents for the moment (you can do it yourself tapping the Play button). As you can see the agents are independent. They move, reproduce and die without your intervention. We don&apos;t want to modify each one individually, but we do want to guide them in order to reproduce what we see in the archaeological data. To achieve this goal I have some cool tools to show you.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M13</key>
	<string>The first one is the orientation marker. Tap twice in any place of the map to suggest the direction of dispersion to your agents.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M14</key>
	<string>The second one is the evolution track. You begin each scenario with 10 Evolution Points or EvoPoints. You can assign to three different traits.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M15</key>
	<string>Let&apos;s begin increasing the rate of movement of your agents with the Mobility attribute. Tap here to spent 1 EvoPoint to move it to Level 2</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M16</key>
	<string>Each additional level will cost you one additional point. Let&apos;s take a look at the second attribute: Reproduction. It controls the interest of your agents for having offspring. This is a critical trait; if your population decreases until 0 you will fail the scenario. Increase it.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M17</key>
	<string>This is level 2, increase it 2 additional levels...</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M18</key>
	<string>Ok the last one, to level 4!</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M19</key>
	<string>Resistance tells you the ability of your agents to survive. This value is combined with the location of your agent to calculate its lifespan. Remember, arid zones and mountains will shorten this lifespan, while forests will make them long-livd. Spend the remanining 3 EvoPoints on moving it to Level 3.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M20</key>
	<string>Increase Resistance to 3 and the setup will be finished.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M21</key>
	<string>It seems that we are set! Let&apos;s see if they survive with these traits</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M22</key>
	<string>You can see in this panel that your population is striving. Let&apos;s suggest them where to expand; set the orientation marker within the goal zone</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M23</key>
	<string>As you can see you get new EvoPoints with time. You can use them to increase or decrease the level of your attributes. Keep in mind that the cost increases with each change so consider what you need</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M24</key>
	<string>I suggest to start increasing Resistance and then focus on Mobility; your population needs to move a large amount of space if you want them to reach the goal before the time is over. Good luck commander!</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M1</key>
	<string>Some missions have more than one goal. As you can see in the Goal bar in the top your population needs to achieve 3 objectives</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M2</key>
	<string>You have to reach to each one in the time span defined by the brighter interval (in this case between 30 and 50). If you arrive before or after this interval the mission will fail.</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M3</key>
	<string>The best arrival time is marked by the brightest interval; your evaluation will be based on how close you get to this evidence.</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M4</key>
	<string>A final note: some zones of the planet, like the huge mountain range in the middle of the map are too hostile to your agents, so they cannot live there. Good luck commander!</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M1</key>
	<string>Welcome commander! We are having problems understanding what happened in this zone so you have a new tool in your console: the T.A.P.A.T.B.C.T.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M2</key>
	<string>This is the acronym for Temporary Augmentation of Population Attributes Through Bursts in Cultural Traits. Beautiful, isn&apos;t it?</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M3</key>
	<string>So...to avoid any strokes the team simply called them Boosts.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M4</key>
	<string>They basically allow you temporaly increase one attribute of your population. You spend EvoPoints using Boosts, so you need to balance changing your attributes with these short-term improvements. After you use them they need a cooldown period because we don&apos;t want the population to rely on this external factor to achieve its goals.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M5</key>
	<string>You got two Boosts for this mission. The first one affects your entire population, and increases its rate of reproduction. Press it now.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M6</key>
	<string>Please don&apos;t ask how did we achieve this baby boom...</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M7</key>
	<string>The second Boost increases the Resistance of the agents in a particular zone. You can tap and drag the finger to the area of effect when you have the needed EvoPoints</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M8</key>
	<string>Both will be needed to see how did they manage to cross the arid zones of this map.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M9</key>
	<string>Distribute your initial EvoPoints and tap Play whenever you are ready.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M10</key>
	<string>Good luck commander!</string>
	<key>LEVEL4M1</key>
	<string>It seems that the archaeologists have new clues so let&apos;s repeat the last experiment with this new evidence.</string>
	<key>LEVEL4M2</key>
	<string>Technological development was quite relevant here so you have control over this attribute instead of Reproduction. On the other hand the available time to reach your goals is considerable shorter</string>
	<key>LEVEL4M3</key>
	<string>It is a peculiar attribute; it is not aparticular behavior of your population, but all of them. When you increase your Technology all the other attributes increase their efficiency</string>
	<key>LEVEL4M4</key>
	<string>Try dispersing your population towards the arid zones increasing their technological skills.</string>
	<key>LEVEL4M5</key>
	<string>Good luck commander!</string>
	<key>LEVEL5M1</key>
	<string>Greetings, Commander. For the first time your agents will have to share this landscape with other populations. The zone around this river was populated before our arrival.</string>
	<key>LEVEL5M2</key>
	<string>Interaction between population is a complex process with a diversity of outcomes; it will range from trade and cultural exchange to open conflict. Usually it is a mix of all these processes.</string>
	<key>LEVEL5M3</key>
	<string>It seems that this first contact with another species was not extremely peaceful. Both of them moved south to colonize these arid zones due to environmental stress caused by overpopulation.</string>
	<key>LEVEL5M4</key>
	<string>You&apos;ll have to use Resistance boosts and Technology to arrive to the different objectives. You should avoid the other population, as they are far more experience on warfare than you.</string>
	<key>LEVEL5M5</key>
	<string>Good luck Commander!</string>

    <key>LEVEL6M1</key>
    <string>Greetings Professor. We have another situation of interaction with a different species.</string>
    <key>LEVEL6M2</key>
    <string>We are certain that this population did not have enough mobility to reach the objectives within the time recorded by archaeologists.</string>
    <key>LEVEL6M3</key>
    <string>This population seems to have increased their mobility so we have added a Boost to this attribute</string>
    <key>LEVEL6M4</key>
    <string>On the other hand, a long time ago someone said that if you can't beat your enemies you can always force them to join you...so we have added another attribute called Influence</string>
    <key>LEVEL6M5</key>
    <string>We are confident that superior mobility and cultural influence would allow your population to ally with the other species and achieve your objectives. It will definitely be faster than fighting them while dispersing.</string>
    <key>LEVEL6M6</key>
    <string>Good luck Professor!</string>
