	<string>Greetings, commander. 

The first tests of the system are already finished. We have discovered the first traces of the alien specie in a forest zone of a small peninsula, from which it seems to have spread to a different ecosystem. The tracker(s)/seeker(s)?? bots are ready to be deployed in a few hours along the surface of Katram 0.2? 

The team is waiting for your orders to start the mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1_INTRO</key>
	<string>Thanks Cassandra. 
This beginnings remind me our own origins. The information recorded by our explorer ships show that Katram 0.2 have very similar environmental conditions to our first settlements in Africa. The earliest evidences of human beings were documented in East African forests about 4 million years ago. These human ancestors, the Australopithecines, had diversified into many forms that shared a vital characteristic: bipedalism. Walking upright enabled them to operate away from the forests in the open terrain of the savannah, giving them a wider food gathering range than other animals. </string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1_DEPLOYMENT</key>
	<string>Well, let&apos;s start the mission: the bots will be deployed along the forest zone with evidences of katramiants ??. We want to explore how they manage to subsist and expand along a very different different ecosystem, similar to the savannas of Planet Earth, till arrive to the objective 1.
Cassandra, please execute the order.</string>
