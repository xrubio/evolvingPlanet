	<string>Greetings, commander. After the initial tests the system is up and running, so we will be able to deploy the bots in the surface of the planet in a few hours.
We have detected the first traces of the alien species in a small peninsula from where they suposedly expanded to the rest of the Sigyn continent. The team awaits your orders to start the mission!</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1</key>
	<string>These beginnings remind me of our own origins...the earliest evidences of human beings were documented in East Africa about 4 million years ago, where archaeologists found a species called Homo Erectus.
The information gathered by the probes sent to Hnoss shows that Sigyn had similar conditions to these first sites...I wonder how they subsisted in this environment; the most probable idea is that they were hunters, gatherers and scavengers, just as our ancestors.

Anyway, let&apos;s start in the beginning; the bots will be deployed in the first zone with evidences of XXX. We want to examine how they dispersed from this peninsula to the rest of the continent.</string>
