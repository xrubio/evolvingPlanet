	<string>DEPLOYMENT</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_1</key>
	<string>Greetings, commander. 

The first tests of the system are already finished. We have discovered the first traces of the alien specie in a forest zone of a small peninsula, from which it seems to have spread to a different ecosystem. The tracker(s)/seeker(s)?? bots are ready to be deployed in a few hours along the surface of Katram 0.2? 

The team is waiting for your orders to start the mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1_INTRO</key>
	<string>Thanks Cassandra. 

This beginnings remind me our own origins. The information recorded by our explorer ships show that Katram 0.2 have very similar environmental conditions to our first settlements in Africa. The earliest evidences of human beings were documented in East African forests about 4 million years ago. These human ancestors, the Australopithecines, had diversified into many forms that shared a vital characteristic: bipedalism. Walking upright enabled them to operate away from the forests in the open terrain of the savannah, giving them a wider food gathering range than other animals. 

Well, let&apos;s start the mission: the bots will be deployed along the forest zone with evidences of katramiants ??.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1_DEPLOYMENT</key>
	<string>We want to explore how they manage to subsist and expand along a very different different ecosystem, similar to the savannas of Planet Earth, till arrive to the objective 1.
Cassandra, please execute the order.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_2</key>
	<string>Greetings, commander. 

The tests of the system made after the first mission are already finished. We have discovered more traces of Katram 0.2 natives in the same peninsula. They seem to have spread to many other different ecosystems. 

The bots are ready and the team is waiting for your orders to start the next mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_2_INTRO</key>
	<string>Thanks Cassandra. 

As we know, after the first movements to other ecosystems, our first ancestors flourished throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa by 3 million years ago. They were hunters, gatherers and scavengers, and remained within the African continent for about 2 million years, as is shown by sites like Olduvay (Tanzania), Koobi Fora (Kenya) and Swartkrans and Sterkfontein (South Africa). 
Is probable that katramiants have behaved in a similar way. </string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_2_DEPLOYMENT</key>
	<string>These are the instructions for Mission 2: the bots will expand to different ecosystems until reaching the objectives 2, 3 and 4, to test how the katramiants spread to different areas.
Cassandra, please execute the order.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_3</key>
	<string>Greetings, commander. 

The tests of the system made after the second mission are already finished. The evidences show that the traces of the natives of Katram 0.2 extend to the entire continent called Sigyn. 

The bots are ready and the team is waiting for your orders to start the next mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_3_INTRO</key>
	<string>Thanks Cassandra. 

Well, the evidences support the similarities between the behaviour of katramiants and human beings. On Planet Earth, due to various reasons (technological innovations? Social relations? Environmental changes? Population Growth ?, â€¦), human groups spread throughout Africa and subsequently Eurasia, colonizing the different environments they found on its path.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_3_DEPLOYMENT</key>
	<string>Cassandra, instructions for Mission 3: the bots will be sent to different ecosystems until reaching the objectives 4 to 8 and then colonize the entire continent called Sigyn. Install additional powers in the bots, we want to imitate the human expansion along the Planet Earth.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_4</key>
	<string>Greetings, commander. 

The tests of the system made after the third mission show that the natives of Katram 0.2 developed and used different types of technology during their expansion to the continent Sigyn. 

The bots are ready and the team is waiting for your orders to start the next mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_4_INTRO</key>
	<string>Thanks Cassandra. 

Ok... technology. The hominid species called Homo Erectus come to my mind. The very earliest examples of Homo erectus date from around 2 million years ago in East Africa. The tools that they made were of significantly improved design from those of their ancestors, and included shaped hand axes and cleaving tools, which were used for specific functions, such as butchering animals. These early humans were skilled hunters and brilliant opportunists, quick to take advantage of different environments, which must have been a key factor in the success of the species. They are known to have used fire, making settlement possible in cold locations, and allowing them to cook food, which in turn led to the evolution of smaller jaws and less robust teeth.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_4_DEPLOYMENT</key>
	<string>The expansion of the Katramiants seems to be very similar. Cassandra, these are the instructions for the next Mission: introduce the capability of developing technology in the bots and repeat the Mission 3. Let&apos;s see what happen with the addition of this element.
Please execute the order.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_5</key>
	<string>Greetings, commander. 

The tests of the system made after the last mission show evidences of the existence of a different alien specie in Katram 0.2. Data collected show that both species were very similar, but the organic and technological remains exhibit certain differences. There is no doubt that both species coexisted in the same environments, commander. </string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_5_INTRO</key>
	<string>Thanks Cassandra. 
In our History we have evidences of similar situations. For example, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens are both human species. In 2014, a study of Neanderthal bones and tools indicates that Neanderthals died out in Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago, and that Homo sapiens arrived in Europe between 45,000 and 43,000 years ago, it is now apparent that the two different human populations shared Europe for as long as 5,000 years. Both species were expert hunters, who pursued animals with wooden and stone-tipped spears. They made sophisticated tools and dwelt in caves, rock shelters, and open camps. They may have been capable of speech. </string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_5_DEPLOYMENT</key>
	<string>Cassandra, please send bots with different characteristics to the surface and repeat the Mission 4. We want to see how they manage the encounter with a different group and how both groups expand. 
Please transmits my orders. </string>

    <key>LEVEL1M1</key>
    <string>Commander, welcome to the Console. Cool interface, isn't it?
I hope you like it because you'll spend the next weeks looking at it! Allow me to give you a quick reminder on how does it work.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M2</key>
    <string>The satellites we deployed around the planet are tracking real-time information about the environment and our agents.
The Console shows you an aggregated of these data, making your life much easier</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M3</key>
    <string>The map shows you the landscape faced by your agents. You can zoom in/out pinching the screen, or pan around sliding your finger through the screen</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M4</key>
    <string>Each scenario is played on a different map containing several geographic features. For example, the zone delimited by this hexagon is a mountain</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M5</key>
    <string>This arid area here has almost no vegetation. Not a comfy area to live.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M6</key>
    <string>Mountains and arid areas delimit regions where resources are scarce, so the agents living there will die faster than usual</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M7</key>
    <string>The environment is not always that dangerous. This zone is a forest, where your agents will find plenty of resources to increase their survival chances</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M8</key>
    <string>Speaking of the devil, these red dots here are your agents. We have deployed a small initial population which is ready to begin evolving.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M9</key>
    <string>This first scenario simulates a dispersion process. Your population needs to colonize the marked zone delimited by the blinking hexagon in your bottom right.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M10</key>
    <string>Your task is to supervise that this population arrives at this goal within a temporal span similar to what the archaeological evidence suggests. The closer you get, the better you understand what happened.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M11</key>
    <string>Let's see what the population is doing; tap the Play button and let it evolve during a couple of time steps.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M12</key>
    <string>I paused the agents for the moment (you can do it yourself tapping the Pause button). As you can see the agents are independent. They move, reproduce and die without your intervention. We don't want to modify each one individually, but we do want to guide them in order to reproduce what we see in the archaeological data. To achieve this goal I have some cool tools to show you.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M13</key>
    <string>The first one is the orientation marker. Tap twice in any place of the map to suggest the direction of dispersion to your agents.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M14</key>
    <string>The second one is the evolution track. You begin each scenario with 10 Evolution Points(EP) that you can assign to three different traits.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M15</key>
    <string>Let's begin increasing the rate of movement of your agents with the Mobility attribute. Tap here to spent 1 EP to move it to Level 2</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M16</key>
    <string>Each additional level will cost you one additional point. Let's take a look at the second attribute: Reproduction. It controls the interest of your agents for having offspring. This is a critical trait; if your population decreases until 0 you will fail the scenario. Increase it.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M17</key>
    <string>This is level 2, increase it 2 additional levels...</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M18</key>
    <string>Ok the last one, to level 4!</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M19</key>
    <string>Resistance tells you the ability of your agents to survive. This value is combined with the location of your agent to calculate its lifespan. Remember, arid zones and mountains will shorten this lifespan, while forests will make them long-livd. Spend the remanining 3 EP points on moving it to Level 3.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M20</key>
    <string>Increase Resistance to 3 and the setup will be finished.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M21</key>
    <string>It seems that we are set! At the beginning of a scenario the dispersion can be rather slow. Tap here to accelerate the metabolism of your agents.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M22</key>
    <string>Now that our population is striving let's suggest them where to expand; set the orientation marker within the goal zone</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M23</key>
    <string>As you can see you get new Evolution Points with time. You can use them to increase or decrease the level of your attributes. Keep in mind that the cost increases with each change so consider what you need. Continue tapping Fast Forward again.</string>
    <key>LEVEL1M24</key>
    <string>I suggest to start increasing Resistance and then focus on Mobility; your population needs to move a large amount of space if you want them to reach the goal before the time is over. Good luck commander!</string>
    <key>LEVEL2M1</key>
    <string>Some missions have more than one goal. As you can see in the Goal bar in the top your population needs to achieve 3 objectives</string>
    <key>LEVEL2M2</key>
    <string>You have to reach to each one in the time span defined by the darker interval (in this case between 30 and 50). If you arrive before or after this interval the mission will fail.</string>
    <key>LEVEL2M3</key>
    <string>The best arrival time is marked by the number; your evaluation will be based on how close you get to this evidence.</string>
    <key>LEVEL2M4</key>
    <string>A final note: some zones of the planet, like the huge mountain range in the middle of the map are too hostile to your agents, so they cannot live there. Good luck commander!</string>    
    <key>LEVEL3M1</key>
    <string>Welcome commander! This mission is more difficult so you have a new tool in your console: the T.A.P.A.T.B.C.T.</string>
    <key>LEVEL3M2</key>
    <string>This is the acronym for Temporary Augmentation of Population Attributes Through Bursts in Cultural Traits. Beautiful, isn't it?</string>
    <key>LEVEL3M3</key>
    <string>So...to avoid any strokes the team simply called them Bursts.</string>
    <key>LEVEL3M4</key>
    <string>They basically allow you temporaly increase one attribute of your population. You spend Evolution Points with this Burst. After you use them they need a cooldown period because we don't want the population to rely on this external factor to achieve its goals.</string>
    <key>LEVEL3M5</key>
    <string>You got two Bursts for this mission. The first one affects your entire population, and increases its rate of reproduction. Press it now and please</string>
     <key>LEVEL3M6</key>
    <string>Please don't ask how did we achieve this baby boom...</string>
    <key>LEVEL3M7</key>
    <string>Distribute your initial EvoPoints and tap Play to see your system evolve with Fast Forward.</string>
    <key>LEVEL3M8</key>
    <string>This second Burst increases the Resistance of the agents in a particular area. Press it and without raising the finger move it over your population. </string>
    <key>LEVEL3M9</key>
    <string>It will be extremely handy if you need to cross an arid region such as the western part of this map</string>
    <key>LEVEL3M10</key>
    <string>Good luck commander!</string>
