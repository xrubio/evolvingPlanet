	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_1</key>
	<string>Campaign day 1

We will use bots to replicate Lovan history. They are a mixture of advanced bioengineering and artificial intelligence designed to resemble the extinct species.

The team is waiting for your orders to start the mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1</key>
	<string>Professor, my name is Dr. Rosalind Lovelace and I'm the leader of the xenoarchaeological team. We will assist you to understand what happened here using bots.  

We deployed the bots in the zone where the first Lovan fossils were found. The environment reminds me of our own origins in East Africa, as our first ancestors lived in a forest similar to this one 4 million years ago.</string>

	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_2</key>
	<string>Campaign day 7

The bots are responding to our commands. We need them to disperse to the rest of the peninsula where they started.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_2</key>
	<string>The success of Lovans allowed them to populate several other ecosystems.
    
    In a similar way our first ancestors flourished throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa using different food sources, from hunting to gathering edible plants.</string>

	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_3</key>
	<string>Campaign day 10

The bots are ready to emulate the colonization of arid zones beyond their usual forest habitats.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_3</key>
	<string>Similarities between Lovan and human origins are surprising...it's our closest match in the entire galaxy.

I won't be extremely helpful here; we know that Lovans spread throghout the entire region, but we are not sure how they managed.

Let's start with population increase and see where do we go from here.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_4</key>
	<string>Campaign day 11

Dr. Lovelace is not convinced of the previous results so we will try a different idea.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_4</key>
	<string>Last reports suggest that Lovan dispersion was way faster than we achieved last mission.

I want to try a different approach; what if we provide the bots with technology?

They should be reach the goals within expected time if they combine fire with stone tools...yeah, I think this will work!</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_5</key>
	<string>Campaign day 16

Lovans found other species as they colonized this world. For this mission we have deployed different bots to replicate the existance of these other groups.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_5</key>
	<string>Our bots will need to interact with other groups during this archaeological expedition.

This planet was not only populated by Lovans, as Earth was not a Sapiens-only club. We shared Eurasia with Neanderthals during 5.000 years. They were also hominins, quite similar to us in any aspect, including technology, culture and even language.

They disappeared as a species over 30.000 years ago; however, our DNA tells us each of us has a small Neanderthal inside...and trust me, DNA never lies!</string>

    <!-- Influence -->
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_6</key>
	<string>Campaign day 17

We discovered that one of the species present in this planet disappeared after contacting Lovans.

Mission control wants to test if they hybridized and became somehow a single species.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_6</key>
	<string>This situation raises a lot of questions.
    
One hypothesis about the extinction of Neanderthals suggests that they were absorbed by the Cro-Magnon population by a mix of cultural influence and hybridation.

Let's try this idea here.</string>
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_7</key>
	<string>Campaign day 20

    We found another extinct species. There is evidence of conflict with Lovans so for this mission your bots will be able to fight.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_7</key>
	<string>And I thought that they were good kids...we discovered a bunch of skeletons with clear signs of violence. 

Violence is not uncommon when different species compete for the same resources. This conflict becomes scarier as social organization and technology increase. Humans have experience on this regard; we almost killed ourselves in the XXth century. I wonder if this could caused the Lovan extinction.
    
In any case they wiped out this species while they invaded their territory, so our bots will have to emulate this situation.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_8</key>
	<string>Campaign day 23

Climate drastically changed through Lovan dispersal. Here the species had to cross a vast zone while resources were rapidly decreasing.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_8</key>
	<string>Hunting and gathering are pretty decent way of living. Ok, you rely on wildlife to survive, but your diet is less boring than if you were a farmer. Plus, you work less hours!

On the other hand you migrate if resources become scarce.
    
In this mission a long drought converted a green forest into a desert. Lovans crossed the area where another group was struggling for survival so let's see how this competition goes.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_9</key>
	<string>Campaign day 25

Looks like this planet was a crowded place. For this mission you will have to face two species simultaneously.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_9</key>
	<string>It seems that you'll find both competition and cooperation here. 

I think that we face here a situation where Lovans allied with one of the groups to attack the other one. I recommend trying to influence the closest ones, and once your group is large enough deal with the rest of objectives.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_10</key>
	<string>Campaign day 30

This mission completes the Lovan dispersal. They proved their adaptive capacity populating the planet from pole to pole.

However, evidence is scarce in this last zone so we are not sure what happened.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_10</key>
	<string>I have some bad news...we don't have a clue why Lovans were successful in this region.

Let's explore this last dispersal by trying different approaches. You can make the bots more aggressive, technologically advanced or capable of influencing other groups.   

The uncertainty is killing me, but this is Science! We accept an explanation until another one proves to be better considering the evidence, as simple as that.</string>
    
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_11</key>
    <string>Campaign day 41
        
Lovans groups bloomed over Kepler-1138. Increased population fostered the development of new technologies and further exploitation of the vast resources of the planet.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_11</key>
    <string>The Lovans exploited any available resource in their environment to improve their survival chances. This would include obsidian and minerals to develop tools and wood for fuel and better housing.

We have deployed these two resources in this mission to understand if Lovans exploited the planet in a similar way than humans did on Earth.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_12</key>
    <string>Campaign day 44
    
Natural resources are shared by all the individuals living in the same landscape.
    
This creates tensions between groups when all of them looked for the same finite resource.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_12</key>
    <string>Food, wood, minerals...nothing is infinite so this availability limits how much population can live in a particular place. This threshold creates competition dynamics between individuals such as the one we observed in this area.

Your bots will need to gain control of this forest from a different group. You have many paths to achieve this mission: increase Influence, Warfare, maybe Mobility?</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_13</key>
    <string>Campaign day 50

Competition is not the only consequence of resource exploitation. We have found evidence of trade between Lovans and a different group in this area.
    
They exchanged minerals and wood; this redistribution of goods benefited both populations.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_13</key>
    <string>This is fascinating, it seems that our kids acquired their first mineral in this region by bartering it for wood. Humans have been trading any sort of good since their beginnings, and it seems that Lovans were not different in this regard.

Your bots will need to learn the complexities of trading before you can pass this mission successfully.</string>
        
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_14</key>
    <string>Campaign day 53
    
Trade contacts is one of the ways that populations influence each other. Lovans got some allies in order to control the mineral resources in one of the richest areas of the planet.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_14</key>
    <string>The exchange of goods is not only about stuff. Trade requires communication between individuals. They not only share goods: they also share ideas.

It seems that Lovans joined forces with another group to control the obsidian present in a mountains range. This event fostered their dominance over the entire region.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_15</key>
    <string>Campaign day 60
    
Lovan conquest of the planet has several causes: from exploitation skills to technological development and cultural influence.
    
In this case they managed to control the resources of a large region at an astonishing pace.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_15</key>
    <string>We are now certain that the Lovan success was partially based on their negotiation skills. Their culture left an imprint on other groups, and some evidence suggests that they were excellent traders.

If we want to match the dates of dispersal here your bots will need to collect a diversity of goods by using a combination of technical and social skills.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_16</key>
    <string>Campaign day 70

Lovans gradually learned how to shape their environment.
    
This would increase their population size to numbers beyond what hunter-gatherer lifestyles could sustain.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_16</key>
    <string>The domestication of plants and animals radically altered human culture on our native planet. Farming and herding allowed us to generate larger amounts of food, thus increasing our population size.

This complex process is called Neolithic, and it seems that we have found a similar situation here.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_17</key>
    <string>Campaign day 74
    
An increase in population size often brings an intensive use of the environment.
    
In this region Lovans combined Terraforming with large scale Exploitation of a forest. However, they managed to avoid the overexploitation of this rich region.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_17</key>
    <string>Initial farming communities did not rely exclusively on crops and cattle. The environment still provided lots of food, so why would you discard them?

But here comes the catch: more food means more people. This can lead to overexploitation of the environment and generate a situation where everybody loses.

Lovans managed to solve the issue, as humans managed to do with the world crisis that happened during mid XXIst century.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_18</key>
    <string>Campaign day 79

It seems that we found the tipping point of Lovan existence.
    
A series of droughts decreased resource availability up to the point where groups started to compete against each other.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_18</key>
    <string>Our analysis suggest that rapidly deteriorating environmental conditions triggered large-scale conflicts.

Our mission here is to understand the link between climate change and conflict as resources became scarce. You can try different options here, but be aware that overexploitation can generate an increase of confrontations</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_19</key>
    <string>Campaign day 87
    
The diminishing population struggled to survive in the deteriorated environment.
    
These are the last steps of Lovans: they disappeared along the other groups as the entire population collapsed in a series of neverending violent conflicts.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_19</key>
    <string>Here we are, after so many challenges: the end of this fascinating story. The lack of arable lands generated several wars. The few chances the remaining population had were ruined as groups threw at each other's throats.

Lovans did survive for some additional decades, though. We will study the last conflict they were involved. You will need to increase their population by Terraformation before another group invades the zone. Be aware that the desperate situation made groups extremely aggressive, so no cultural influence is possible in this mission.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_20</key>
    <string>Campaign day 90
    
Good job, the experiment is finished!
    
However, something unexpected happened. Bots should have disappeared after the last mission, but they are still there. You must disable the remaining population before leaving Kepler.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_20</key>
    <string>I don't know how to explain this: the bots ignored our last orders and are currently looking for some land where they can still survive.

We got our final results and technically we should destroy these last bots before leaving this planet. I don't know what you feel, but more than finishing an experiment it seems more like a genocide to me.

You cannot fail this mission: either you finish the story again, or you give Lovans another chance. Professor, this is your call.</string>
