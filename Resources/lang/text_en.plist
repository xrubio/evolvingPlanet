	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_1</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 1

We will use bots to replicate Lovan history. They combine advanced bioengineering with artificial intelligence designed to resemble the extinct species.

The team is waiting for your orders to start the mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1</key>
	<string>Professor, my name is Dr. Rosalind Lovelace and I’m the leader of the xenoarchaeological team. We will help you to understand what happened here using bots.

We deployed an initial population of bots in the area where the first Lovan fossils were found.

The environment reminds me of our own origins in East Africa, as our first ancestors lived in a forest similar to this one 4 million years ago.</string>

	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_2</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 7

The bots are correctly responding to our commands.

We need them to disperse to the rest of the peninsula where they started.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_2</key>
	<string>The success of the Lovans allowed them to populate several other ecosystems.
	  
Our first ancestors flourished throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa in a similar way, using different food sources, from hunting to gathering edible plants.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_3</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 10

The bots are ready to emulate the colonization of arid zones beyond their usual forest habitats.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_3</key>
	<string>Similarities between Lovan and human origins are surprising… They provide our closest match in the entire galaxy.
	  
I won’t be extremely helpful here. We know that Lovans spread throughout the entire region, but we are not sure how they managed it.

Let's start with population increase and see where we go from there.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_4</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 11

Dr. Lovelace is not convinced of the previous results, so we’ll try a different idea.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_4</key>
	<string>The latest reports suggest that Lovan dispersion was much faster than what we achieved in the last mission.
	  
I want to try a different approach: what if we provide the bots with technology?

They should reach the goals by the expected time if they combine fire with stone tools. Yeah, I think this will work!</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_5</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 16

The Lovans discovered other species as they colonised the planet. For this mission, we have deployed different bots to replicate the existence of these other groups.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_5</key>
	<string>Our bots will need to interact with other groups during the archaeological expedition.
	  
The planet was not populated only by Lovans, just like the Earth was not a Homo sapiens-only club. We shared Eurasia with Neanderthals  for 5,000 years. They were also hominins quite similar to us in many respects, including the use of technology, culture and even language.

The Neanderthals disappeared as a species over 30,000 years ago. However, our DNA says that each of us has a little bit of Neanderthal inside. And trust me, DNA never lies!</string>

    <!-- Influence -->
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_6</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 17

We discovered that one of the species present on this planet disappeared after contacting the Lovans.

Mission control wants to test if they interbred and somehow became a single species.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_6</key>
	<string>This situation raises many questions.
	  
One hypothesis about the extinction of the Neanderthals suggests that they were absorbed into the Cro-Magnon population through a mix of cultural influence and hybridisation.

Let's try out this idea here.</string>
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_7</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 20

We have discovered another extinct species. There is evidence of conflict with the Lovans, so for this mission your bots will be able to fight.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_7</key>
	<string>And I thought that they were good kids… We discovered a bunch of skeletons with clear signs of violence.
	  
Violence is not uncommon when different species compete for the same resources. This conflict becomes scarier as social organisation and technology increase. Humans have experience in this regard, as we almost wiped ourselves out in the 20th century. I wonder if violence could have caused the Lovan extinction.    

In any case, they wiped out this species while they invaded their territory, so our bots will have to emulate the situation.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_8</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 23

The climate drastically changed during the Lovan dispersal. Here the species had to cross a vast area while resources were rapidly decreasing.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_8</key>
	<string>Hunting and gathering make for a pretty decent way of life. Sure, you must rely on wildlife to survive, but your diet is not as boring as it would be if you were a farmer. Plus, you work less hours!
	  
On the other hand, you have to migrate if resources become scarce.

In this mission, a long drought turned a green forest into a desert. The Lovans crossed the area where another group was struggling for survival, so let’s see how the competition goes.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_9</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 25

It looks like this planet was a crowded place. For this mission, you will have to face two species simultaneously.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_9</key>
	<string>Cooperation and competition are two processes that often happen at the same time.
	  
I think that we face a situation here where the Lovans allied with one of the groups to attack the other one. I recommend trying to influence the closest group, then dealing with the remaining objectives once your group is large enough.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_10</key>
	<string>Campaign Day 30

This mission completes the Lovan dispersal. They proved their adaptive capacity by populating the planet from pole to pole.

However, evidence is scarce in this last area, so we are not sure what happened.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_10</key>
	<string>I have some bad news… We don’t have a clue why the Lovans were successful in this region.	  

Let's explore this last dispersal by trying different approaches. You can make the bots more aggressive, technologically advanced or capable of influencing other groups.

The uncertainty is killing me, but this is science! We accept an explanation until another one proves better in light of the evidence, as simple as that.</string>
    
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_11</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 41
        
Groups of Lovans bloomed over Kepler-1138. Increased population fostered the development of new technologies and further exploitation of the vast resources of the planet.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_11</key>
    <string>The Lovans exploited any available resource in their environment to improve their chances of survival. This included obsidian and minerals for crafting tools and wood for fuel and better housing materials.
      
We have deployed these two resources in this mission to understand if the Lovans exploited the planet in a similar way to what humans did on Earth.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_12</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 44
    
Natural resources are shared by all the individuals living in the same landscape.

This creates tensions between groups when they all look for the same finite resource.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_12</key>
    <string>Food, wood, minerals… nothing is infinite, and the availability of these goods limits the size of the population that can live in a particular place. This threshold creates competitive dynamics between individuals such as the one we observed in this area.
      
Your bots will need to gain control of this forest from a different group. You have many paths to achieve this mission: through increasing Influence, Warfare or even Mobility.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_13</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 50

Competition is not the only consequence of resource exploitation. We have found evidence of trade between the Lovans and a different group in this area.

They exchanged minerals and wood. The redistribution of goods benefited both populations.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_13</key>
    <string>This is fascinating, it seems that our kids acquired their first mineral in this region by bartering it for wood. Humans have been trading all sorts of goods since their beginnings and the Lovans were no different in this regard.

Your bots will need to learn the complexities of trading before you can pass this mission successfully.</string>
        
    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_14</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 53
    
Trade contact is one of the ways that populations influence each other. The Lovans gained some allies in order to control the mineral resources in one of the richest parts of the planet.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_14</key>
    <string>The exchange of goods is not only about stuff. Trade requires communication between individuals. They not only share goods: they also share ideas.
      
It seems that the Lovans joined forces with another group to control the obsidian in a mountains range. This led to their dominance over the entire region.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_15</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 60
    
The Lovan conquest of the planet has several causes: from the use of exploitation skills to technological development and their strong cultural influence.
    
In this case, they managed to control the resources of a large region at an astonishing pace.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_15</key>
    <string>We are now certain that the Lovans’ success was partially based on their negotiation skills. Their culture left an imprint on other groups and some evidence suggests that they were excellent traders.
      
We want to match the dates of dispersal here. To achieve this goal your bots will need to collect a wide range of goods by using a combination of technical and social skills.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_16</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 70

The Lovans gradually learned how to shape their environment.

This would increase their population size to numbers beyond what hunter-gatherer lifestyles could sustain.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_16</key>
    <string>The domestication of plants and animals radically altered human culture on our native planet. Farming and herding allowed us to generate larger amounts of food, thus increasing our population size.

This complex process is called Neolithic, and it seems that we have found a similar situation here.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_17</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 74
    
An increase in population size often leads to intensive use of the environment.

The Lovans combined Terraforming this region with large-scale Exploitation of a forest. However, they managed to avoid overexploiting this rich zone.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_17</key>
    <string>The first farming communities did not rely exclusively on crops and cattle. The environment still provided lots of food, so why would they discard it as a source of richness?
      
But there is a difference: agriculture is able to sustain more people. The situation has a cost, as a large population size will increase the risk of overexploiting the environment and exhausting the available resources.

The Lovans managed to solve the issue, as humans managed to do with the world crisis that took place in the mid-21st century.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_18</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 79

It seems that we found the tipping point of Lovan existence.

A series of droughts decreased resource availability up to the point where groups started to compete against each other.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_18</key>
    <string>Our analysis suggests that rapidly deteriorating environmental conditions triggered large-scale conflicts.
      
Our mission here is to understand the link between climate change and conflict as resources became scarce. You can try different options here, but be aware that overexploitation can lead to increasing confrontation between groups.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_19</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 87
    
The diminishing population struggled to survive in a degraded environment.

These are the last steps of the Lovans: they disappeared along with the other groups as the entire population collapsed in a series of violent and never-ending conflicts.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_19</key>
    <string>Here we are, after so many challenges: the end of this fascinating story. The lack of arable land sparked several wars. The few chances the remaining population had were ruined as groups went for each other’s throats.
      
The Lovans did survive for a few more decades, though. We will study the last conflict in which they were involved. You will need to increase their population through Terraforming before another group invades the area. Be aware that the desperate situation made groups extremely aggressive, so no cultural influence is possible in this mission.</string>

    <key>BRIEF_LEVEL_20</key>
    <string>Campaign Day 90
    
Good job, the experiment is finished!
    
However, something unexpected happened. Bots should have disappeared after the last mission, but they are still there. You must disable the remaining population before leaving Kepler-1138.</string>
    <key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_20</key>
    <string>I don't know how to explain this, but the bots ignored our last orders and are currently looking for some land where they can survive.
      
We got our final results and technically we should destroy these last bots before leaving this planet. I don't know how you feel, but rather than finishing an experiment it seems more like genocide to me.

How do you want us to proceed? Either we finish the story again or we give the Lovans another chance. Professor, it’s your call.</string>
