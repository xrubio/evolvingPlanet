	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_1</key>
	<string>Greetings, Professor. 

We will use bots to replicate the history of the Lovans. They are a mixture of advanced bioengineering and artificial intelligence that has been fitted to recreate the extinct species.

The team is waiting for your orders to start the mission.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_1_INTRO</key>
	<string>Professor, my name is Dr. Agatha Walker and I'm the leader of the xenoarchaeological team. We will assist you to understand what happened here using bots.  

    We deployed the bots in the zone where the first fossils of Lovans were found. The environment reminds me of our own origins in East Africa, as our first ancestors lived in a forest similar to this one 4 million years ago.</string>

	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_2</key>
	<string>Greetings, Professor. 

The bots seems to respond correctly to our commands. We need them to disperse to the rest of the peninsula where they started.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_2_INTRO</key>
	<string>The success of the Lovans allowed them to populate several other ecosystems.
    
    In a similar way our first ancestors flourished throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa using different food sources.
    
    They were hunters, scavengers and also consumed any edible part from plants.</string>

	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_3</key>
	<string>Greetings, Professor. 

The bots are ready to emulate the colonization of arid zones beyond their usual forest habitats.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_3_INTRO</key>
	<string>Similarities between the beginnings of the Lovans and human beings are surprising...will we find the same pattern in the entire galaxy?

I won't be extremely helpful here; we know that hominins spread throghout the entire planet Earth, but we are not sure why.

Let's start with population increase and see where do we go from here.</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_4</key>
	<string>Greetings, Professor. 

Dr. Walker is not convinced of the previous results so we will try a different idea.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_4_INTRO</key>
	<string>Last reports suggest that the dispersion of the Lovans was way faster than we achieved last mission.

I want to try a different approach; what if we provide the bots with improved technology?

They should be able to achieve the goals within expected time if they combine fire with stone tools...yeah, I think this should work better!</string>
	<key>BRIEF_LEVEL_5</key>
	<string>Greetings, Professor. 

The Lovans found other species as they colonized this world. For this mission we have deployed different bots to replicate the existance of these other groups.</string>
	<key>CONTEXT_LEVEL_5_INTRO</key>
	<string>We will have interaction with several other species during this archaeological expedition.

This planet was not only populated by the Lovans, as Earth was not a Sapiens-only club. We shared Eurasia with Neanderthals during 5.000 years. They were also hominins, quite similar to us in any aspect, including technology, culture and even language.

They disappeared as a species over 30.000 years ago; however, based on what our DNA tells us each of us has a small Neanderthal inside...and trust me, DNA never lies!</string>

	<key>LEVEL_1_STORY</key>
	<string>Who are we? Who created us?</string>
    <key>LEVEL_2_STORY</key>
	<string>Our destiny is to arrive to the mountain of fire</string>
    <key>LEVEL_3_STORY</key>
	<string>We are the masters of fire. We are the Zho'll</string>
    <key>LEVEL_4_STORY</key>
	<string>Fire and stone are our tools. With the help of our Guides we will conquer this world.</string>
    <key>LEVEL_5_STORY</key>
	<string>We will not be afraid of anyone or anything.</string>
    <key>LEVEL_6_STORY</key>
	<string>The Guides watch us and provide for us</string>
    <key>LEVEL_7_STORY</key>
	<string>Do we need the Guides? The Zho'll already own this land!</string>
    <key>LEVEL_8_STORY</key>
	<string>But we are not alone...</string>
    <key>LEVEL_9_STORY</key>
	<string>The Zho'll will succeed where others failed.</string>
    <key>LEVEL_10_STORY</key>
	<string>Why do we have to obey the Guides and move again?</string>
