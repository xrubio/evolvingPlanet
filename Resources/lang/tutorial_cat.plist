	<string>Comandant, benvingut a la Consola. La interfície mola eh?
Espero que t&apos;agradi, perquè de fet gastaràs la major part de les properes setmanes mirant-la! Deixa&apos;m fer-te un ràpid resum de com funciona.
</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M2</key>
	<string>Els satèl·lits que hem desplegat al voltant del planete rastregen informació en temps real de l&apos;entorn i els nostres agents.
La consola mostra un agregat de totes aquestes dades, fent-te la vida més fàcil</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M3</key>
	<string>Aquestes zones són muntanyes i àrees àrides. Són regions a on és més difícil trobar recursos, per la qual cosa els agents que estiguin aquí moriran més ràpid del normal</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M4</key>
	<string>Each scenario is played on a different map containing several geographic features. For example, the zone delimited by this hexagon is a mountain</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M5</key>
	<string>This arid area here has almost no vegetation. Not a comfy area to live.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M6</key>
	<string>Mountains and arid areas delimit regions where resources are scarce, so the agents living there will die faster than usual</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M7</key>
	<string>The environment is not always that dangerous. This zone is a forest, where your agents will find plenty of resources to increase their survival chances</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M8</key>
	<string>Speaking of the devil, these red dots here are your agents. We have deployed a small initial population which is ready to begin evolving.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M9</key>
	<string>This first scenario simulates a dispersion process. Your population needs to colonize the marked zone delimited by the blinking hexagon in your bottom right.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M10</key>
	<string>Your task is to supervise that this population arrives at this goal within a temporal span similar to what the archaeological evidence suggests. The closer you get, the better you understand what happened.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M11</key>
	<string>Let&apos;s see what the population is doing; tap the Play button and let it evolve during a couple of time steps.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M12</key>
	<string>I paused the agents for the moment (you can do it yourself tapping the Pause button). As you can see the agents are independent. They move, reproduce and die without your intervention. We don&apos;t want to modify each one individually, but we do want to guide them in order to reproduce what we see in the archaeological data. To achieve this goal I have some cool tools to show you.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M13</key>
	<string>The first one is the orientation marker. Tap twice in any place of the map to suggest the direction of dispersion to your agents.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M14</key>
	<string>The second one is the evolution track. You begin each scenario with 10 Evolution Points(EP) that you can assign to three different traits.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M15</key>
	<string>Let&apos;s begin increasing the rate of movement of your agents with the Mobility attribute. Tap here to spent 1 EP to move it to Level 2</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M16</key>
	<string>Each additional level will cost you one additional point. Let&apos;s take a look at the second attribute: Reproduction. It controls the interest of your agents for having offspring. This is a critical trait; if your population decreases until 0 you will fail the scenario. Increase it.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M17</key>
	<string>This is level 2, increase it 2 additional levels...</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M18</key>
	<string>Ok the last one, to level 4!</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M19</key>
	<string>Resistance tells you the ability of your agents to survive. This value is combined with the location of your agent to calculate its lifespan. Remember, arid zones and mountains will shorten this lifespan, while forests will make them long-livd. Spend the remanining 3 EP points on moving it to Level 3.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M20</key>
	<string>Increase Resistance to 3 and the setup will be finished.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M21</key>
	<string>It seems that we are set! Let's see if they survive with these traits</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M22</key>
	<string>Now that our population is striving let&apos;s suggest them where to expand; set the orientation marker within the goal zone</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M23</key>
	<string>As you can see you get new Evolution Points with time. You can use them to increase or decrease the level of your attributes. Keep in mind that the cost increases with each change so consider what you need.</string>
	<key>LEVEL1M24</key>
	<string>I suggest to start increasing Resistance and then focus on Mobility; your population needs to move a large amount of space if you want them to reach the goal before the time is over. Good luck commander!</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M1</key>
	<string>Some missions have more than one goal. As you can see in the Goal bar in the top your population needs to achieve 3 objectives</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M2</key>
	<string>You have to reach to each one in the time span defined by the darker interval (in this case between 30 and 50). If you arrive before or after this interval the mission will fail.</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M3</key>
	<string>The best arrival time is marked by the number; your evaluation will be based on how close you get to this evidence.</string>
	<key>LEVEL2M4</key>
	<string>A final note: some zones of the planet, like the huge mountain range in the middle of the map are too hostile to your agents, so they cannot live there. Good luck commander!</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M1</key>
	<string>Welcome commander! This mission is more difficult so you have a new tool in your console: the T.A.P.A.T.B.C.T.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M2</key>
	<string>This is the acronym for Temporary Augmentation of Population Attributes Through Bursts in Cultural Traits. Beautiful, isn&apos;t it?</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M3</key>
	<string>So...to avoid any strokes the team simply called them Boosts.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M4</key>
	<string>They basically allow you temporaly increase one attribute of your population. You spend Evolution Points using Boosts, so you need to balance changing your attributes with these short-term improvements. After you use them they need a cooldown period because we don&apos;t want the population to rely on this external factor to achieve its goals.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M5</key>
	<string>You got two Boosts for this mission. The first one affects your entire population, and increases its rate of reproduction. Press it now and please</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M6</key>
	<string>Please don&apos;t ask how did we achieve this baby boom...</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M7</key>
	<string>Distribute your initial EvoPoints and tap Play to see your system evolve with Fast Forward.</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M8</key>
	<string>This second Boost increases the Resistance of the agents in a particular area. Press it and without raising the finger move it over your population. </string>
	<key>LEVEL3M9</key>
	<string>It will be extremely handy if you need to cross an arid region such as the western part of this map</string>
	<key>LEVEL3M10</key>
	<string>Good luck commander!</string>
