   <string>The first human ancestors appeared 4 million yeas ago in the forests of East Africa.

The oldest species were called Australopithecines. They already walked in two legs, and it seems that this property allowed them very important for their success. They managed to live in a diversity of environments, from forests to savannah.</string>

    <string>Australopithecus, Homo Habilis or Homo Neanderthal were different species of hominins. They were quite diverse, but all of them shared being bipeds, having small teeth and big brains. Homo Sapiens is the only surviving hominin.</string>

    <string>The british ship HMS Beagle left Plymouth in 1831 towards South America; her crew included a young man called Charles Darwin.
The data he collected during the voyage was crucial to develop his theory of evolution by natural selection.
They returned to Europe 5 years later after circumnavigating the Earth.</string>

    <string>Culture makes humans so flexible that they currently live in all environments that can be imagined.
    
The Tubu live in an African region called Ténéré, the country of emptiness. The women are able to find the only water well in thousands of squared kilometers with the only orientation of dune movement and the stars.</string>

    <string>Our ancestors started using tools 2 million ago. Technology was not an isolated innovation, as it seems that hominins also started using language during the same period.</string>

    <key>ACH_LVL4_3</key>
    <string>Culture is not only a human thing. Apes, dolphins and orcas show complex cultural traits such as tools and language. However, the pace at which we learn and create new ideas makes us quite unique.</string>

    <string>Kepler-1138 is an exoplanet. Exoplanet means external solar planet: a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. Over 2000 exoplanets have been discovered, most of them by the Kepler space telescope since its launch by NASA in 2009.</string>

    <string>Recent advances in biology demonstrate that part of our genetic information comes from Neanderthals.
    
They are not our ancestors, so this information means that both species coexisted and interbred in Europe 35.000 years ago.</string>

    <string>Conflict with Sapiens? Climate change? Competition for resources? We don't know why Neanderthals became extinct and we are fascinated about it.

Understanding the extinction of Neanderthals could help us understand the risks we currently face.</string>

    <key>ACH_LVL9_3</key>
    <string>The more we know about Neanderthals the more we see the similarities with us. This interest has generated several fiction works, such as the novels "The Clan of the Cave Bear" by J.M. Auel and the science-fiction trilogy "The Neanderthal Parallax", by Robert J. Sawyer.</string>

    <string>The finding of several cave paintings created the wrong idea that our ancestors lived in caves.
    
This image is wrong; they moved around the territory and only used caves occasionally as a refuge. Paintings in caves have just better chance to be preserved after thousands of years.</string>

    <string>The moon landing conspiracy suggests that the mission was filmed by directory Stanley Kubrick on Earth.
In reality this director and NASA only shared cameras. Some scenes of his movie Barry Lindon were filmed using just candlelight, thanks to a camera model owned by the space agency.</string>
