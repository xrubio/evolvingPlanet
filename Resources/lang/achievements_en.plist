    <string>Evolving Planet story unfolds in an imaginary exoplanet called Kepler-1138.

An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. Over 2000 exoplanets have been discovered, most of them by the Kepler space telescope since its launch by NASA in 2009.</string>

   <string>The first human ancestors appeared 4 million yeas ago in the forests of East Africa.

The oldest species were called Australopithecines. They already walked in two legs, and it seems that this property allowed them very important for their success. They managed to live in a diversity of environments, from forests to savannah.</string>

    <string>The Tubu live in an African region called Ténéré, the country of emptiness. The women are able to find the only water well in thousands of squared kilometers with the only orientation of dune movement and the stars.

    <string>The british ship HMS Beagle left Plymouth in 1831 towards South America. She returned to Europe 5 years later after circumnavigating the Earth.
Her crew included a young man called Charles Darwin. The data he collected during the voyage was crucial to develop his theory of evolution by natural selection.</string>

    <string>The first pregnancy for women in current hunter-gatherer societies is around 19 years. This was probably the case for people living in all the planet until the adoption of sedentary lifestyles such as farming made it decrease.

It did not increase again in Western societies until the XXth century.</string>

    <string>Our ancestors started using tools 2 million ago. This technology was not an isolated innovation, as other cultural traits need to be present in order to learn and transmit this knowledge.
    
For this reason it is not surprising that hominins started using language during the same period.</string>

    <string>The more we know about Neanderthals the more we see the striking similarities between them and us. This interest has not only generated scientific debate but also several fiction works.
    
Three of the most interesting are the movie "Quest for Fire" by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the historical novel "The Clan of the Cave Bear" by J.M. Auel and the science-fiction trilogy "The Neanderthal Parallax", by Robert J. Sawyer.</string>

    <string>Recent advances in biology demonstrate that part of our genetic information comes from Neanderthals.
They are not our ancestors, so this genetic share was caused by both species coexisting and interbreeding in Europe 35.000 years ago.</string>
    <key>ACH_LVL6_3</key>
    <string>Culture is not property of humans. Apes, dolphins and orcas show complex cultural traits such as tools and language. However, the pace at which we learn and create new ideas makes us quite unique.</string>

    <string>One of the first documentaries ever made tried to explain to Western people how was hunter-gatherer life.
Nanook of the North was filmed by Robert J. Flaherty in 1922. It explained the struggle for survival of a family of Inuit living in the Arctic under extreme conditions.</string>
    <key>ACH_LVL8_3</key>
