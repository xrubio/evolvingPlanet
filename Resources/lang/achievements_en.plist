    <string>Evolving Planet story unfolds in an imaginary exoplanet called Kepler-1138.

An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. Over 2000 exoplanets have been discovered, most of them by the Kepler space telescope since its launch by NASA in 2009.</string>

    <string>The first human ancestors appeared 4 million yeas ago in the forests of East Africa.

The oldest species were called Australopithecines. They already walked in two legs, and it seems that this property allowed them very important for their success. They managed to live in a diversity of environments, from forests to savannah.</string>

    <string>Our ancestors started using tools 2 million ago. This technology was not an isolated innovation, as other cultural traits need to be present in order to learn and transmit this knowledge.
    
For this reason it is not surprising that hominins started using language during the same period.</string>

    <string>The more we know about Neanderthals the more we see the striking similarities between them and us. This interest has not only generated scientific debate but also several fiction works.
    
Three of the most interesting are the movie "Quest for Fire" by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the historical novel "The Clan of the Cave Bear" by J.M. Auel and the science-fiction trilogy "The Neanderthal Parallax", by Robert J. Sawyer.</string>
