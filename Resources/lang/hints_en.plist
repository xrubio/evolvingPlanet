    <string>You should increase Resistance and then focus on Mobility.</string>
	<key>LEVEL2HINT</key>
	<string>Tap the goal icon to show the features of the map. You should move your population to forests to increase their chance of survival.</string>
    <key>LEVEL3HINT</key>
	<string>Increasing resistance is critical to avoid extinction at the beginning of this mission.</string>
	<key>LEVEL4HINT</key>
	<string>Increasing technological skills will improve the rest of attributes of your bots.</string>
	<key>LEVEL5HINT</key>
	<string>You should avoid the other population. They are far more experienced on warfare than you.</string>
	<key>LEVEL6HINT</key>
	<string>The Lovans did not have enough reproduction rate to reach this population size within the observed time. The new Influence boost can be used to convince bots from other groups to join yours.</string>
	<key>LEVEL7HINT</key>
	<string>You should increase both your population and Warfare skills before meeting the other group.</string>
	<key>LEVEL8HINT</key>
	<string>You need a lot of population to cross the desert. Increase Resistance and Influence before entering the eastern part of the map.</string>
	<key>LEVEL9HINT</key>
	<string>Increase Reproduction and Technology to survive the first difficult times.</string>
	<key>LEVEL10HINT</key>
	<string>Avoid the desert until your Technology is good enough to sustain life there.</string>
    <key>LEVEL11HINT</key>
	<string>The exploitation rate depends on the skills of your group and its size. Forests regenerate over time so you should avoid its overexploitation by limiting this rate or moving to other zones.</string>
    <key>LEVEL12HINT</key>
	<string>Everything you need is in the forest so avoid moving outside these regions.</string>
    <key>LEVEL13HINT</key>
	<string>You will probably need wood from the two forests to reach the goal. Your population should try to reach the eastern one before the other agents overexploit the region.</string>
    <key>LEVEL14HINT</key>
	<string>Your low exploitation rate can be balanced with multiple strategies. You can use a population boost, eliminate the competition or join forces with them.</string>
    <key>LEVEL15HINT</key>
	<string></string>
    <key>LEVEL16HINT</key>
	<string>Keep your population in the forest as long as possible. This zone has better survival rates than the open landscape.</string>
